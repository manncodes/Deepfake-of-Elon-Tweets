Good night, everyone!
At my request, the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (hire us if you want all the energy) will both have a charge over AC (consumer) estimate, so prob fine.
@collinalexbell yes
@ER of course gravity
@erikhaaland no problem
@ronei_cthough @DanRetz2508 @ccyuan2013 @TeslaMotors @Tim_Stevens Absolutely. He did an amazing job, but we don't deserve credit.
@tim_ Stevens Took our car for a ride. Very enjoyable.
@kelseyeongreen @ThePhoenixFlare Maybe not everyone who interviewed for the job, but we got her too.
@ThePhoenixFlare I love Tim
@kelseyeongreen @ThePhoenixFlare What happened to the footage from the chase plane?
@ThePhoenixFlare In the aircraft. We lost control and we had to abort the flight. Rescue underway.
@robertgaal @keithal (anastasiampson's voice) Hikei!
@keithal Yes, but it is not needed. We will get back to Ramos and get the plane back to Earth.
@robertgaal @keithal The chase plane was flying at Mach 7.9.3, so was flying at 310 km/h. Apogee?
@KehlFirst To be fair, the helium leak was minor compared to the others
@tim_Stevens Something messed up here. The ignition sequence was not perfect, but ZERO REI.
@tim_Stevens The leaky seal on the Powerpack is from one battery overheating. Adding 2 to 1 to existing recall.
@TheRicardo @Reza_Zadeh Sad to hear that. Just announced a few days ago.
