@FredericLambert Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text

@vladsavov Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors.
@FifthRocket Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
@KENEMONICS You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
@martinengwicht Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
@paulvankeep Mostly anti-drug laws
@zgiarrizzo Exactly
@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law.
@humplik The remedy for that is changing the law
@CallumK24 Ok, but what's up the wigs?
@iLexomat There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
@Biesseman True!
Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served.

Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin & turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.

@SwiftOnSecurity Tricky in 140 chars, but: 1B needed for min statistical sample size. More software mods and data may be needed beyond that.
Blog on Autopilot by @PeterDiamandis https://t.co/LR5zuw3J9X
@bolayer @SwiftOnSecurity US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
@c4757p @SwiftOnSecurity Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
@FantaAIex It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience.
@SwiftOnSecurity With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
@nicatronTg @SwiftOnSecurity Thanks. Point of calling it beta was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect.
@_CraigR @FortuneMagazine exactly
@wfederman @stegen @FortuneMagazine that wasn't criticism, just clarification
@SwiftOnSecurity why?
@wfederman @stegen @FortuneMagazine thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
@vicentes Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
@stegen @FortuneMagazine you're right, no point
@chirag Use of word beta is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense.

Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck https://t.co/Sa6uCkpknY
Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
@fucktyler Thanks Tyler
Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
@AstroOrionMK @BadAstronomer Quite rapid... Yes

Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY
https://t.co/I0QQ2D3BtE
@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.
Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
Rocket landing speed was close to design max & used up contingency crush core, hence back & forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.
Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good.

Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg
@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.
@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.

@AmarnathRevanna Air suspension dynamically adjusts ride height
@GatorWass you can do that now with S and X. Will be same for 3.
@_elombardo @rjpryan correct
@EduardoForneck hopefully 0.21
@PeteEhmKay @gerardomarina what's the link to that?
@tapwin No, but we will need to build a factory in Europe to serve long-term regional demand as Fremont reaches max capacity.
@mpatfield no problem
@CrackedUpCorson Will cover whole country hopefully this year
@AndersRytter yes, but production AWD will be a lot faster
@AlexBelohlavek less
@torvos torque is shifted between front & rear motors every ~.01 secs. Traction control is way better than a normal AWD. Digital vs analog.
And, of course, it will have more cowbells.
Model 3 will be RWD, with dual motor AWD optional. Even RWD will have great traction on ice due to fast torque response of Tesla drivetrain.
@GolfsHard yes
@Zooropa88 @TeslaMotors Superchargers and service centers will cover all of Italy later this year
@_Only_Hawk @MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter definitely
@Alandbru @TeslaMotors should be addressed this year
@CmaxVs Only way to get enough rear passenger headroom was to move the rear roof cross-car support beam. A bike will still fit no problem.
@iKrivetko that's not the real steering system
@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
@RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
@jeffrey @neutyp Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
@WaltNew cool, thanks!
@mindthreat @RyanHummer Yes, if the trend continues, before

@grebakshay We are working on an exact date, but Tesla will be in India before 3 production starts.
@Model3Owners They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
@vicentes Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit.
@Aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines
@raytech247 yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity.
@squallcraft and a few other things
Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order.
@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp.
253k as of 7am this morning
@sundarpichai thanks!
Now 232k orders
@GrahamABlair of course :)
@Jbourquee Giga is designed to self-power via solar panels (primarily), wind & geo, using its own batteries to store electricity at night.

@stunt_penguin @LayOn_OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced.
@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
If speed at stage separation > ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
@mbhnyc steel collet
Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. https://t.co/w007TccANJ
@Uncle_Gus probably
However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating.

Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
Ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.

@alankerlin Hydraulics are usually closed, but that adds mass vs short acting open systems. F9 fins only work for 4 mins. We were ~10% off.
Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock!
Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month.
Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.
Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.
Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...

The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger: https://t.co/gTaURQQeyx
@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign & more data. Maybe flight 21.
Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for x-wing style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll.
Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel & rocket flyback in future.

The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower & weighs 160 lbs
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably <50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

Technically, I got rich from Zip2 & PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla & SolarCity.
If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods & critical meds.
@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt.
Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems.
Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.
Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
Me & other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way.
@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census.
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases.
Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide.
Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good & disincent bad.
